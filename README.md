# Assignment: Weather Dashboard
## Description 

For this assignment, we were asked to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

We used the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.

The site uses `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
